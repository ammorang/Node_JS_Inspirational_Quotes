# Node_JS_Inspirational_Quotes

NODE LAB
Task: Construct a Node server that will be able to send information from a module on your back-end to your front-end.

What does the application do?
1. When the user navigates to localhost:3000, it will display one random quote from a list.
Build Specifications:
1. The server.js file must require an external module that you have created.
2. The external module will consist of an array of quotes, which must be exported.
3. Has to send a random quote from the list to the front-end.
4. When testing in Chrome, you should see it giving you different random quotes when
you refresh the page.

NOTE: You can use random quotes, or facts, or whatever you want. (Obviously should be work-appropriate.)
